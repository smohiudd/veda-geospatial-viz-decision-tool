# Geospatial File Decision Tool

A React SPA that helps users determine the best VEDA visualization service for their geospatial files. Upload a file or provide an S3/HTTPS link to get recommendations for services like titiler-pgstac, titiler-multidim, titiler-cmr, or tipg.

## Features

- **Step 1: File Input** - Provide S3/HTTPS URLs to geospatial files or CMR concept URLs
- **Step 2: Validation** - Real-time validation using multiple APIs
  - COG validation via OpenVEDA API
  - CMR compatibility checking via AWS Lambda endpoint
- **Step 3: Visualization Options** - Smart recommendations based on file characteristics
  - For COG files, includes ready-to-use [OpenVEDA raster API](https://openveda.cloud/api/raster/) tile URLs
  - For CMR datasets, recommends titiler-cmr exclusively

> **Note:** Supports direct file URLs and CMR concept URLs from [Earthdata](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov).

### Supported Input Types
- **Direct Files:** COG, NetCDF, GeoParquet, GRIB, HDF5 (via S3/HTTPS URLs)
- **CMR Datasets:** Earthdata Cloud collections via CMR concept URLs
  - Example: `https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C1996881146-POCLOUD.html`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project is configured to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages when you push to the `main` branch.

#### Setup Instructions

1. **Enable GitHub Pages in your repository:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to Settings → Pages
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"

2. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Wait for the deployment:**
   - The GitHub Action will automatically run
   - Check the "Actions" tab to see the deployment progress
   - Once complete, your app will be available at the GitHub Pages URL

The deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) is based on the [spatial-access-measures deployment workflow](https://github.com/developmentseed/spatial-access-measures/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml).
